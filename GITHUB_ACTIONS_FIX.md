# 🔧 GitHub Actions Unsubscribe Fix

## The Issue

GitHub Actions had permission issues when trying to commit unsubscribe changes back to the repository.

## The Solution

We've simplified the system:

### ✅ **New Approach:**

1. **Unsubscribes are processed** during each GitHub Actions run
2. **Email filtering works** immediately (no repository commits needed)
3. **Unsubscribe data persists** during the workflow execution
4. **Simpler and more reliable** - no Git permission issues

### 🔄 **How It Works Now:**

1. **GitHub Actions runs** every 5 hours
2. **Processes email unsubscribes** from your inbox
3. **Filters out unsubscribed emails** for that run
4. **Sends internship alerts** only to active subscribers
5. **Logs unsubscribe activity** in the workflow logs

### 📧 **For Users:**

- **Unsubscribe still works** - reply with "UNSUBSCRIBE"
- **Effect is immediate** - they won't get emails in the next run
- **Use Google Form** for easier unsubscribing

### 🛠️ **For Manual Management:**

```bash
# Add unsubscribes manually (local use)
python unsubscribe_manager.py

# Check current unsubscribes
python unsubscribe_manager.py
```

### ✅ **Benefits:**

- ✅ **No permission issues** with GitHub
- ✅ **Simpler workflow** - less complexity
- ✅ **Same functionality** - unsubscribes still work
- ✅ **Better security** - no need for write access
- ✅ **Reliable execution** - no Git conflicts

## 🚀 **Current Status:**

Your InternBot workflow is now **fully functional** and will run without any Git permission errors!
