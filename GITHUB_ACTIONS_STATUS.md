# GitHub Actions Integration Guide

## Current Status: âœ… FULLY COMPATIBLE

Your existing GitHub Actions workflow will continue working exactly as before. The React frontend is a separate web interface that doesn't affect your automated bot.

## Enhanced Integration (Optional)

If you want to integrate the React frontend subscriber system with GitHub Actions, here are the options:

### Option 1: Keep Current System (Recommended)

- Your GitHub Actions continue working with `RECIPIENT_EMAILS` secret
- React frontend operates independently for new signups
- No changes needed to existing workflow

### Option 2: Integrate Subscriber Database

If you want GitHub Actions to use the React frontend's subscriber list:

1. **Update collect.py to use website subscribers:**

```python
# Add to collect.py
import sys
import os
sys.path.append('website')

try:
    from website.app import get_subscriber_emails
    subscriber_emails = get_subscriber_emails()
    print(f"Found {len(subscriber_emails)} website subscribers")
except ImportError:
    print("Website integration not available, using env variables")
    subscriber_emails = []
```

2. **Update send_batch_email_only.py:**

```python
# Add to send_batch_email_only.py
def get_all_recipients():
    # Original static recipients
    env_emails = os.getenv('RECIPIENT_EMAILS', '').split(',')
    env_emails = [email.strip() for email in env_emails if email.strip()]

    # Website subscribers
    try:
        sys.path.append('website')
        from website.app import get_subscriber_emails
        website_emails = get_subscriber_emails()
    except:
        website_emails = []

    # Combine and deduplicate
    all_emails = list(set(env_emails + website_emails))
    return [email for email in all_emails if email]
```

3. **Update GitHub workflow to include website data:**

```yaml
# Add to .github/workflows/internship-bot.yml
- name: Install website dependencies
  run: |
    cd website
    pip install -r requirements.txt

- name: Create subscriber data directory
  run: |
    mkdir -p website/data
```

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)

- Keep static emails in GitHub secrets for core users
- Add website subscribers as additional recipients
- Both systems work independently

## Current Workflow Analysis

Your existing workflow:

```yaml
name: Automated Internship Bot
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 */5 * * *" # Every 5 hours
  workflow_dispatch:
```

**Status: âœ… WORKS PERFECTLY**

- Scrapes internships every 5 hours
- Sends emails to RECIPIENT_EMAILS
- No interference from React frontend
- All secrets and configurations remain valid

## Recommendation

**Keep your current GitHub Actions as-is.** It's working and reliable.

If you want to add website subscribers later:

1. Test the integration locally first
2. Add website data as additional recipients
3. Keep your core email list in GitHub secrets as backup

Your bot will continue running automatically every 5 hours regardless of the React frontend! ðŸš€
