# 🎯 Smart Internship Scheduler - Enhanced Features

## ✅ **NEW SMART FREQUENCY CONTROL**

### 📧 **Email Sending Rules**

- **Maximum emails per day**: 3 emails
- **Minimum time between emails**: 4 hours
- **Frequency**: Every 5 hours + scheduled times (9 AM, 2 PM, 7 PM)
- **Only sends when**: NEW internships are found (never repeats!)

### 🤖 **Smart Logic**

```
IF new internships found AND can send email (frequency limits) THEN
    ✅ Send email with date information
    📊 Update counter (emails sent today)
    💾 Save state for tracking
ELSE
    ❌ No email sent (as intended)
    📝 Log the reason (no new jobs OR frequency limit reached)
```

### 📅 **Daily Schedule**

- **Morning Check**: 9:00 AM
- **Afternoon Check**: 2:00 PM
- **Evening Check**: 7:00 PM
- **Additional**: Every 5 hours (flexible timing)

### 🔒 **Anti-Spam Protection**

1. **Daily Reset**: Email counter resets every new day
2. **State Persistence**: Tracks last email sent time across restarts
3. **Frequency Enforcement**: Won't send if less than 4 hours since last email
4. **New Content Only**: Only sends when genuinely new internships are found

## 📊 **Enhanced Email Format with Date Information**

### 🕐 **Date Display Features**

- **Posted Date**: "3 days ago", "1 week ago", etc. (when available)
- **Application Deadline**: "Apply by: 15 Jan" (when available)
